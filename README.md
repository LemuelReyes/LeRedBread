##Experience on working on this project:

I've built Wordpress websites before, using templates and plugins without the coding, but nothing like this before.
I've learnt the power of Wordpress and now understand why it is the most popular CMS out there.  

Navigating the back-end admin section and setting up the environment (plugins, themes, etc.) was familiar and easy, but
making custom post-types, taxonomies, building widgets expanded my understanding and appreciation for Wordpress.

Now I believe, I can create websites that are user friendly to clients.  Sites easily customizable, easy, and fast.
